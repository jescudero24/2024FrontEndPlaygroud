    <br>Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast number 125: Moving.
    <br>
    <br>Welcome back to English as a Second Language Podcast episode 125. I’m your host, Dr. Jeff McQuillan, from the Center for Educational Development in, where else, beautiful Los Angeles, California.
    <br>
    <br>This podcast, like all of our podcasts, is made possible by the work of Dr. Lucy Tse who writes the scripts and does most of the work involved here. I am the voice of the podcast and Lucy does all the work so, as usual, we want to thank her for everything she does.
    <br>
    <br>Today’s podcast is going to be about someone moving from one house or one apartment to another house or apartment. Let’s go!
    <br>
    <br><strong>[start of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: What are you doing?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is finishing his degree at the university.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are you using a moving company?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he graduates.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your mail?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Thanks for the offer. I've submitted a change-of-address form to the post office so I hope my mail will get forwarded automatically. One thing I have to remember to do is to shut off the utilities: gas, electricity, and phone‚ but I'll have two more weeks to do that.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Well, good luck in Vancouver. I don't envy you. I hate moving. Let me know if you need any help with those boxes.
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
    <br>
    <br><strong>[end of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>We’re talking about someone who needs to move from one house or apartment or one city to another city. In this dialogue, we begin with Edmundo saying, “What are you doing?” And Ruth, his friend, says, “Oh, I’m packing.” “I’m packing” (packing). “To pack” means to put things in a box or in a suitcase – in a bag – so that you can take them somewhere else. If you are going on a trip, you pack a bag or a suitcase. If you are moving, you have to pack everything in your house, put things in boxes and in bags to move them.
    <br>
    <br>So, Ruth says she’s packing because her “lease is up” at the end of the month. A “lease” (lease) is a contract. It’s a legal agreement when you rent an apartment or a house; you have to sign a contract. We call that contract a “lease.” When you rent a house or an apartment or a car, anything that you are going to use, you have this lease. So, you sign a lease. When the lease is over, when your contract is over, we say that your “lease is up.” “Your lease is up.” It’s just an idiom that we have. So, Ruth’s lease is up at the end of the month and we learnt that she is moving to Vancouver.
    <br>
    <br>Well, Edmundo says, “Wow” (wow) – is an expression of surprise or when something is really amazing to you. Unusually , you might say, “Wow.” Edmundo says, “Wow, are you moving yourself or are you using a moving company?” Well, “to move yourself” would mean you would put everything in your own car and drive there. To use a moving company is a company with a big truck that comes and people put your things into the truck and the truck drives to your new house – your new apartment - and they “unpack.” Notice the opposite of pack is to “unpack” (unpack) – all one word. So, they take your things and they put them into your new house. Actually, to unpack means to take things out of the boxes – just moving the boxes into your house – your new house is not the same as “unpacking,” technically. Although there are some companies that if you pay them enough money, they’ll pack and unpack your house.
    <br>
    <br>Well, Ruth says that she is going to move herself. She’s doing it by herself and she’s renting a “U-Haul.” Well, “U-Haul” is the name of a company that rents trucks to individual people so they can use their big trucks for moving. It’s just one company, but it’s a very company in the entire United States. So, when someone says they’re renting a “U-Haul” – and I should explain U-Haul is spelled (U) – the capital (U)-(HAUL). “To haul” (haul) is similar to move. The verb “to haul” means to move. So, “U-Haul” means you are going to move. You are going to haul your things. So, someone says, “I’m renting a U-Haul” – they mean a truck from the company called “U-Haul.”
    <br>
    <br>Ruth says she’s putting some of her furniture, her chairs, her tables, her couch, – couch is the same as a sofa – in “storage.” When we say, “I’m going to put something in storage” (storage) they mean that you are going to rent a place that will keep your things for however long you want them to. You have to pay them. So, you have a little space where you can put all of your things and there are many companies that have big buildings where you can rent a little part of the space – very popular in Los Angeles. And this is called “storage.”
    <br>
    <br>So, she’s putting some of her things in storage and when she moves back to whatever city she is in, she will then take it out of storage and be able to use it again. Edmundo offers to help Ruth. “Can I help?” he says. “Do you need me to forward your mail?” “To forward” (forward) – as a verb – “to forward” – means that something – you get a letter. It comes to you and you forward it to someone else. So, you mail it again to someone else. In the United States, there is just one government – semi-government, partially government supported company that delivers regular mail – the United States Postal Service. There are many private companies which will also deliver letters, packages, boxes – companies like Federal Express or, another very popular one is called “UPS” – United Postal Service. Those are private companies. But for your regular mail – for your bills, for the letters, normal letters, you use the government sponsored United States Postal Service. People usually just call it the “post-office.” Well, if you are going to move, you need to tell the post-office where your new address is and they will forward your mail. So, instead of sending it to your old address, they will send it to your new address – this is called “forwarding” your mail.
    <br>
    <br>Ruth says to Edmundo, “Thanks for the offer,” meaning thank you for asking me to help. She says, “I’ve submitted a change of address form to the post office.” A “change of address form” (form) is just a little card that says, “Hey, I’m moving. Please send my mail to this new address.” And if you are going to move in the United States, you usually have to send that card at least a couple of weeks before. Some post offices, some places, it can be a shorter time. But it’s safer to send it early. And then you tell them, “Beginning on this day, I want my mail forwarded. “ Well, this is a change of address form and she submitted (submitted) – means she gave, in this case, she submitted the form to the post-office – her local post-office – the post office where she lives right now. And she, therefore, says that her mail will get forwarded automatically, so that she doesn’t have to do anything special.
    <br>
    <br>She says, “One thing I have to remember is to shut off the utilities.” “Utilities” (utilities) are the gas, the electricity, the water, your phone – these are all your utilities at a house or an apartment. “To shut off the utilities” means to turn off. But we use that special verb “to shut off” especially for gas, electricity and water. So, you shut off your utilities, you stop them. So, you tell the gas company, “I’m leaving.” You tell the phone company, “I want you to get rid of this number.” So, you cancel or shut off all of these different things and you have to do that before you move.
    <br>
    <br>Well, Edmundo wishes Ruth good luck in Vancouver. She’s moving to the city of Vancouver in Canada. He says, “I don’t envy you. I hate moving.” “To envy” (envy) means the same as to be jealous. I want what you have. You, for example, you buy a new car – a nice car. And I want your car. I “envy you,” meaning I want to have what you have. But Edmundo says, “I don’t envy you,” meaning it’s not a very pleasant good thing to have to move. But he tells her, “Let me know if you need any help.” “Let me know” means tell me if you need any help.
    <br>
    <br>Now let’s listen to the dialogue this time at a native rate of speech.
    <br>
    <br><strong>[start of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: What are you doing?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Oh, I'm packing. My lease is up at the end of the month and I'm moving to Vancouver for six months while my boyfriend is finishing his degree at the university.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Oh, wow. Are you moving yourself or are you using a moving company?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: I'm renting a U-Haul and doing it myself. I'm putting some of my furniture in storage since we plan to move back here after he graduates.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Can I help? Do you need me to forward your mail?
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Thanks for the offer. I've submitted a change-of-address form to the post office so I hope my mail will get forwarded automatically. One thing I have to remember to do is to shut off the utilities: gas, electricity, and phone‚ but I'll have two more weeks to do that.
    <br>
    <br>Edmundo: Well, good luck in Vancouver. I don't envy you. I hate moving. Let me know if you need any help with those boxes.
    <br>
    <br>Ruth: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

    <br><strong>Culture Note</strong>
    <br>The U.S. Census
    <br>
    <br>According to the U.S. Constitution, the “federal” (national) government must “take a census” (count the number of people) living in the United States every 10 years. The first census was in 1790, so every year ending in zero is a census year. One of the main reasons for the census is to determine how “to allot” (to divide among different people or groups of people) the 435 members that “form” (are part of) the United States House of Representatives, the officials who represent the people of the United States and make laws. States that have more people get more representatives, and states that have a smaller population are given fewer representatives, but the number of representatives is always 435. In order to “take into account” (consider; make part of a decision) births, deaths, and “migration” (moving from one part of the country to another), the government counts every 10 years and then makes any necessary changes. During the 1980s and 1990s, for example, states in the Southwest U.S., such as Arizona, Nevada, and California, increased their number of representatives due to more people moving to those states for jobs.
    <br>
    <br>How does the U.S. Census “Bureau” (office) collect “data” (information) to count people? First, it mails a letter to every “residence” (house, apartment, or other place where people live) in the U.S. with a “survey” (a list of questions). Most people get a two- or three-page survey that they are asked “to fill out” (to complete) and mail back to the government within about two weeks. The survey asks just a few questions, including the names of everyone living in your house, your telephone number, whether you own your residence or rent it, your age, your sex, your birthday, your “income” (how much money you make), and your “race” (such as African American, Asian American, and white). It is very simple and short, and is available in many different languages.
    <br>
    <br>One more interesting fact about the U.S. Census: the Census Bureau counts everyone, even people who are living here “without permission” (illegally). The government also promises to keep the information secret for at least 72 years so that people will be honest and not “withhold” (refuse to give) information they are asking for.<br></div>

    <br>
    <br>This episode is called “Eating Spoiled Food.” “Spoiled food” is food that is no longer good to eat. We’ll listen to a dialogue between Ryan and Corrie using a lot of vocabulary that you might see or hear describing spoiled food. Let’s get started.
    <br>
    <br><strong>[start of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: I’m happy to do it. First, though, let’s see what you have in your fridge.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I have tons of food in there.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: What is that? It looks moldy.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Oh, that’s cheese. I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date. This expired three months ago. What about this?
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: That’s hamburger. Maybe you could make some spaghetti with meatballs.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Not with this rotten meat. It’s definitely gone bad. Can’t you tell by the discoloration? Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Nope. It’s gone sour, and you might as well throw out this bread, too. It’s stale.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tainted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted. You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I don’t like things to go to waste.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: I guess not. I’m still willing to make you dinner, but we’ll have to do some shopping. My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the market.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!
    <br>
    <br><strong>[end of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Ryan begins our dialogue by saying, “It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.” A “home-cooked meal” would be, of course, one that you make yourself in your house. Corrie says, “I’m happy to do it. First, though, let’s see what you have in your fridge.” So, Corrie is over at Ryan’s apartment or house and she is agreeing to cook a meal for him, so she looks inside of his fridge. “Fridge” is short for refrigerator; it’s a box that keeps cold where you store or put your food. Ryan says, “I have tons of food in there.” Notice we say “tons of food,” it’s very common for informal English to use this idea of “tons,” meaning a lot. A “ton,” of course, is 2,000 pounds, but here it just means a lot of food.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie then asks, “What is that? It looks moldy.” “Moldy” (moldy) comes from the word “mold,” which are small green plants, really, that grow on things usually because they are old or wet, especially food. Ryan says, “Oh, that’s cheese. I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.” Corrie says, “Okay, but look at the ‘best if used by’ date.” Most food, especially fresh food that you would put in your refrigerator for example, has a date on it after which you shouldn’t probably eat it. That’s what Corrie means by the “best if used by” date, meaning this food should be used by a certain date. “This expired three months ago,” she says. “To expire” means something has passed its time; it is no longer able to be used. In this case, it’s for food that is too old to be eaten; it’s no longer good.
    <br>
    <br>Then Corrie says, “What about this?” pointing to something else. Ryan says, “That’s hamburger. Maybe you could make some spaghetti with meatballs.” Corrie says, “Not with this rotten meat.” “Rotten” (rotten) comes from the verb “to rot” (rot), which means to spoil, to decay so that you can’t use it anymore. Rotten meat would be meat that is no longer good to eat because it is too old. Corrie says that the hamburger has definitely gone bad. “To go bad” means to become rotten, to become spoiled, to become so that you can no longer eat it. “To go” has, of course, hundreds of meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for just a few more of those.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie then says, “Can’t you tell by the discoloration? Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.” “Discoloration” is when something changes its color, usually to indicate that there is a problem or that it has gone bad. Ryan says, “I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?” Corrie says, “Nope,” an informal way of saying no – “nope” (nope). “It’s gone sour.” “To be sour” means to have spoiled, to have an unpleasant taste or smell, especially if we are talking about milk or something made from milk. Corrie says, “you might as well throw out this bread, too. It’s stale.” The expression “you might as well” is used to suggest that someone do something or to indicate what you should do. “Stale” (stale) is the opposite of “fresh.” When we’re talking about bread, stale bread would be dry and old, fresh bread would be soft and moist. Ryan then says, “Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?” meaning isn’t any of my food any good. This is the problem if you walk into my kitchen, I don’t have a lot that you could eat!
    <br>
    <br>Corrie says, “Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tainted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted.” There are several words there that we use to describe particular kinds of food or things that you eat that go bad. Let’s start with the first one about the oil. Corrie says, “this oil (such as vegetable oil or olive oil) is rancid.” We use “rancid” (rancid) specifically to talk about oil or fat or food that has fat in it that goes bad – that spoils. It usually will have a bad smell and a bad taste. Corrie also says that the butter looks “tainted.” You could also use the adjective “rancid” when talking about butter. But Corrie, here, is saying that the butter is “tainted.” Here, she means that it is not safe to eat; it is perhaps something that could even hurt you. She says, “the vegetables are wilted.” “Wilted” is when a vegetable that is normally stiff and crisp (that is, it normally is sort of hard) becomes very soft and the leaves of it are weak. For example if you have lettuce, which is a green food that you use in salads, if the lettuce is put in the heat the leaves of the lettuce – the pieces of lettuce will wilt (wilt). So she says the vegetables are “wilted,” meaning they are no longer fresh. She also says that Ryan’s canned goods are “rusted.” “Canned” means it is food that you buy in a can that you then open. “Canned goods” could include things like tomato sauce or corn; many different kinds of food can be purchased in a can. But these canned goods – these canned foods are rusted. The actual can is made of metal, and the metal, if it is very old, can turn brown creating something we call “rust.” Well, you don’t want to eat canned food that comes from the cans that are rusted, there could be something there that could make you sick.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie says, “You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.” Ryan says, “I don’t like things to go to waste.” The expression “to go to waste” means that you don’t use it; not using something that you paid money for. But of course, if you wait too long, well, the food will no longer be able to be eaten. Corrie says, “I guess not,” meaning I guess you don’t like to waste things. That’s obvious by the fact that he didn’t throw anything away. Corrie says, “I’m still willing to make your dinner, but we’ll have to do some shopping. My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poisoning. “Food poisoning” is when you get very sick because of something that you have eaten. I had food poisoning about 10 years ago, where I had to go to the hospital because I was so sick. I won’t tell you where I ate, although the restaurant is still here in Los Angeles. So if you come to Los Angeles I’ll tell you which restaurant you should not eat at!
    <br>
    <br>Anyway, Corrie says that she needs to buy some new food so that she can prepare the meal – some fresh food. Ryan says, “Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the market,” place where they sell, in this case, food. Corrie says, “And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!” “To get rid of” means to throw out. The term “hazardous waste” is usually one that we apply to chemicals that are very dangerous. Corrie is making a joke here; she’s saying that the food is old and so spoiled that it is like a hazardous waste. “Hazardous” comes from the word “hazard,” meaning something that could cause you harm, something that is dangerous.
    <br>
    <br>Now let’s listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
    <br>
    <br><strong>[start of dialogue]</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: It’s really nice of you to make dinner for me. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a home-cooked meal.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: I’m happy to do it. First, though, let’s see what you have in your fridge.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I have tons of food in there.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: What is that? It looks moldy.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Oh, that’s cheese. I’m sure it’s still good, if we just cut off the moldy parts.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Okay, but look at the “best if used by” date. This expired three months ago. What about this?
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: That’s hamburger. Maybe you could make some spaghetti with meatballs.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Not with this rotten meat. It’s definitely gone bad. Can’t you tell by the discoloration? Meat isn’t supposed to be gray.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I guess you’re right. I bet this milk isn’t any good either, is it?
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Nope. It’s gone sour, and you might as well throw out this bread, too. It’s stale.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Isn’t there anything you can use in this kitchen?
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: Well, this oil is rancid, this butter looks tainted, the vegetables are wilted, and even your canned goods are rusted. You do have a lot of food in your kitchen, but it’s been here a long, long time.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: I don’t like things to go to waste.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: I guess not. I’m still willing to make you dinner, but we’ll have to do some shopping. My cooking isn’t the best, but I don’t usually give people food poisoning, and I don’t want to start now.
    <br>
    <br>Ryan: Okay, okay, give me a list and I’ll go to the market.
    <br>
    <br>Corrie: And while you’re there, I’ll see what I can do about getting rid of all of this hazardous waste!

    <br><strong>What Else Does It Mean?</strong>
    <br>to go bad
    <br>
    <br>The phrase “to go bad,” in this podcast, means to become spoiled, rotten, bad, and unusable: “How many months can meat be kept in the freezer before it goes bad?” The phrase “to go mad” means to become crazy or insane: “Have you gone mad? What’s wrong with you?” The phrase “to go gray” means for one’s hair to change color as one gets older: “She started coloring her hair when she noticed that it was starting to go gray.” The phrase “to go hungry” means to not have enough money to buy food: “It must be horrible to watch your children go hungry.” Finally, the phrase “to go all out” means to try very hard to do something, or to use maximum effort: “She went all out at the audition, but she didn’t get the part.”
    <br>
    <br>sour
    <br>
    <br>In this podcast, the word “sour” means for milk or milk-related products to have a spoiled, unpleasant taste or smell: “This cake tastes horrible. Did you make it with sour milk?” The word “sour” is usually used to talk about acidic foods, like lemons and limes: “The children really like sour, lemon-flavored candies.” The phrase “sour grapes” is used to talk about someone who pretends not to like something, even though he or she really would like to have it or do it: “Franklin said bad things about the car his brother bought, but it was really a case of sour grapes, because he would have bought the same car if he’d had enough money.” Finally, if something “turns sour,” it becomes less pleasant: “She and her husband used to have a great relationship, but their marriage lately has turned sour.”
    <br>
    <br><strong>Culture Note</strong>
    <br>Recently there have been many regional and national food-related “health scares” (something that makes people worry about their health) in the United States. Many of these have been food “recalls,” which happen when a company realizes that the food it sells is unsafe and so it tries to get people to bring it back to the stores where it was purchased.
    <br>
    <br>In the past, “sprouts” (very small, young plants, often eaten on sandwiches or in salads) and “spinach” (dark green leaves, often eaten in salads or cooked) have been recalled because they “harbor” (contain) a bacteria known as Escherichia coli that causes food poisoning and can make people very sick.
    <br>
    <br>Early in 2009, the United States had a large peanut recall when a company called the National Peanut Corporation realized that some of its products were “contaminated” (infected, or made impure) with “salmonella,” which is another type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning or even death. Many other companies used products from the National Peanut Corporations to make their own products, and all of those foods had to be recalled, too.
    <br>
    <br>Previously, the United States had a “huge” (very large) recall of “beef” (meat from cows), because it found some meat that was infected with “mad cow disease” (a disease that can be transmitted from cows to humans when humans eat beef).
    <br>
    <br>All of these food recalls have “raised concerns” (made people worry) about food safety and the government’s ability to “track” (follow the movements of) food from its “origin” (where something is made) to where it is “consumed” (eaten).
